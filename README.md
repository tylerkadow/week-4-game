# week-4-game

Further expanding my JavaScript knowledge, I used the Math.Random() function to create four random values for the crystal buttons. I created a function for resetting the values so that I did not have to re-type those attributes over and over again.

In the future, I plan on populating the crystal variables in a way that I am not repeating the same code over and over again.
